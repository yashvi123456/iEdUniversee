            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most
                school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that
                system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces
                (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational
                activities, and more.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education
                system through various elements such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can
                refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also
                guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.The
                Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has found that schools tend to perform best when
                principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core
                subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and
                improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.
